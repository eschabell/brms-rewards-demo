This branch created for eventual completion as addition to the Rewards Demo.
Added this TODO for the items listed below as stated in pull 2.
============================================================================

Thanks patrick, but a few comments:

1. This is only the web side (repo.zip), the demo can't be extended with all these kinds of bits. It needs the JBDS side too.

2. The process extends an existing simple process. I would prefer it to be a separate process.

3. The process needs to be colorized to match the existing format of the rest of the demo.

4. The process image in the project does not match the process (some transition names), so displaying the image in business-central
is not correct image.

5. It looks like (no documentation so not sure) rewards above 1000 need manager approval, so would make more sense to name the
process variable accordingly, is less vague that way and more self documenting.

6. The adaption is not applied nor reported in the final e-mail if approved and submitting 2000 as reward. Everything between
1-10000 should set -10 in your table?

7. Too much debug and some in German:

12:47:14,031 INFO  [stdout] (Thread-124) --> Leaving Node <Adapt Reward>

8. No documentation update as to how to use this in the Quickstart Guide.

As you can see, there would be much work yet to be done before I release this into the process wild. 

That being said, I will leave it on a branch for now 'patrick-webrule-p2', if I can find time down the road to work on this I will
try to complete the demo and add it as a third process. I will add these notes to the Readme in the branch as a TODO.
